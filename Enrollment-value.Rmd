This is a table of East Bay Zipcodes and their median home values with zipcodes as the column names.
```{r}

Spreadzips but with differences to 94704

Attempt at writing a forloop that failed
#```{r}
for (i in 2:nrow(spreadzips)) {
  diff<-spreadzips[i]-spreadzips[19]
mutate}
diffspreadzips
```
function that takes the diff between 94704 and chosen zipcode
#```{r}
diff <- function (zipcode){
  zipcodediff<-spreadzips$`94704` - spreadzips$`zipcode`
return(zipcodediff)} 
```

#```{r}
<-spreadzips%>%
  mutate()

```

#```{r}
%>%
  mutate(`94704`=log(`94704`))%>%
  mutate(`94530`=log(`94530`))%>%
  mutate(`94609`=log(`94609`))%>%
  mutate(diff94530 =`94704` - `94530`)%>%
  mutate(diff94609 =`94704` - `94609`)%>%
  ggplot(aes(date)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = diff94530, colour = "94530")) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = diff94609, colour = "94609"))
```

Moving values to differences compared to 94704:
first select 94704 values vector 
```{r}
southside<-spreadzips$`94704`
southside
```

remove dates from values matrix so there are just integers
```{r}
nodates<-spreadzips%>%
  select(-date)
nodates
```
Simple matrix subtraction and readding the dates column (in the appropriate place)
```{r}
basicdiff<-nodates-southside
valuediffs<-basicdiff%>%
  merge(spreadzips$date)%>%
  mutate(date=y)%>%
  select(date, everything())
valuediffs
```

Graph it!
```{r}
valuediffs%>%
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=date) +
```
